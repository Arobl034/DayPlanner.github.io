As an employee with a busy schedule I wan to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively. I seek to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

1. The app should display standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

2. The time

3. A field to hold user input

4. A save button

5. Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.
